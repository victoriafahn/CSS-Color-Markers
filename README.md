# Color Marker Set

This project involves creating a set of color markers using CSS. The focus is on applying linear gradients and shadows to achieve a visually appealing design. Colors are specified using `rgba` and `hsla`, allowing for experimentation with transparency and color combinations.

## Features

- **Linear Gradients**: Create smooth transitions between colors.
- **Shadows**: Apply realistic effects using the `box-shadow` property.
- **Color Formats**: Use of RGBA and HSLA color formats for advanced color control.

## Technologies

- **HTML**: Structuring the marker elements.
- **CSS**: Styling with gradients, shadows, and color formats.
